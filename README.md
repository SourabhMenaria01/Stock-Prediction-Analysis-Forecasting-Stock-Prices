Stock Market Price Prediction using R
Introduction
Welcome to the Stock Market Price Prediction project! This project aims to forecast stock market prices using the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model in R. We utilize historical stock price data for AAPL (Apple Inc.) obtained from Yahoo Finance. Through data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and time series modeling, our goal is to predict future stock prices and evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.

Key Components
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Retrieve historical stock price data for AAPL from Yahoo Finance using the quantmod package.
Apply data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values and ensure data integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explore trends, patterns, and correlations in the stock price data through EDA.
Visualize data using candlestick charts, line plots, and autocorrelation functions.
ARIMA Modeling:

Select the ARIMA model for time series forecasting due to its ability to capture time-dependent patterns in stock prices.
Fit the ARIMA model to the training data and generate predictions for future periods using the forecast package.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the accuracy of the ARIMA model using performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and visual inspection of forecasted values against actual stock prices.
